            <p>I am a Post Degree Diploma in Web and Mobile Development student at Langara College,&nbsp; based in

            <p>I consider myself as a curious person that enjoys putting my creativity into every project that I face.</p>
            <p>When Iâ€™m not trying to learn and discover new things about development and design, I enjoy playing video
                games, chilling with my cats, or trying new outdoor activities.</p>
